## What is MCPClient?
#### MCPClient is a Minecraft Pentesting client that allows you to connect to a Minecraft server and perform various tasks, such as impersonating another player using uuid spoofing, using custom client commands, and more. This tool is useful for pentesters who want to test the security of a Minecraft server.

## Features
- Impersonate another player using uuid spoofing
- Custom client commands

## Installation
1. Install Java 21 or higher
2. Install Fabric loader 0.15.11 (1.21) or higher
3. Download the latest release from the [releases page](https://github.com/pedroagustinvega/mcpclient/releases)
4. Extract the zip file
5. Copy the .jar files to your Minecraft mods folder
6. Run Minecraft with the Fabric loader profile

## IMPORTANT
- This project is still in development and many features have not been implemented yet.
- This project is not intended to be used in a production environment without legal authorization.
- Currently, a reboot is required after the first run for Discord Presence and the client icon to work properly.

## Commands
- `/mcphelp` - Displays a list of commands
